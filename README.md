👩‍💻 **About Me - Bridging Gaps with Bytes**

As a former Product Manager with a four-year background in aligning consumer needs with product benefits, I've redirected my career path toward software engineering.\
Currently an Informatics student at the University of Washington, I'm refining my technical skills to bridge the gap between business strategy and technical implementation.\
I'm passionate about user-centric design and creating solutions that resonate with users' needs, as demonstrated by the projects hosted in this repository.
